# HotelReservationsSystem
On-line Hotel Reservations

This is my course project in ASP.Net MVC in the Telerik Academy.

The program has a site administration area where the site administrator can create Hotel Administrators, then hotel administration area where the hotel administrator can input the information about his hotels.

Anyone can view the created hotels list and once registered can make reservations.
